        <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>        
        <p>
            The <ubah>Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</ubah>, <ubah>Sebelas Maret University</ubah>, Surakarta is an <ubah>Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</ubah> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing <ubah>superior, strong and intelligent educational staff</ubah>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <ubah>Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</ubah> study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the <ubah>Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</ubah> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are <ubah>prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</ubah>. So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as <ubah>Building Engineering Education</ubah>, and <ubah>Mechanical Engineering Education</ubah>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <ubah>resource sharing with the mathematics study program</ubah>.
